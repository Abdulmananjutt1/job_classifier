**Job Classifier using Logistic Regression**

This project implements a Job Classification Model that predicts job categories from text data using Logistic Regression. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and processed through multiple stages before training:

**Key Features**
**Data Cleaning** – Removing unnecessary symbols, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.

**Tokenization** – Splitting sentences into individual words/tokens.

**Stopword Removal** – Eliminating common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not contribute to classification.

**Vectorization** – Converting text into numerical features using techniques such as Count Vectorizer or TF-IDF.

**Train-Test Splitting** – Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

**Model Training** – Applying Logistic Regression to learn patterns from the processed text data.

**Evaluation** – Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Prediction Script** – Allows users to input new text and get the predicted job category instantly.

**Use Cases**
Resume or job posting classification

Automated recruitment systems

Job recommendation engines

This repository provides a simple yet effective baseline for text classification tasks and can be extended with advanced models such as SVM, Random Forest, or Deep Learning architectures.
